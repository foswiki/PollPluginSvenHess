---++ Description
The plugin allows you to setup polls and let wiki users vote for it.
A poll includes one or more suggestions/innovations/ideas (e.g.) to vote for, 
which are described in a topic for each suggestion. Treat those topic as an idea, suggestion or
innovation you want to get voted.
   
There is a configuration topic for each poll to define all users and to set 
a number of credit points for them. All these users can now participate
in that poll and share their credit points out on sevaral topics belonging to the poll.

---++ Usage

---+++ Setup new poll
To setup a new poll simply add =%<nop>POLLSETUP%= to a topic. 
It will automatically inserts the necessary table for configuration: 

| *Header* | *Description* | 
| username | name of wikiuser who participate |
| credit points | number of remaining credit points to share out |
| latest vote | datetime of users last vote |
| comment | use it for any comment about that user | 

Each table row defines a wikiuser and a number of credit points. 
Add as many wikiusers as you want to join your poll.

Additionally another table will be inserted which is used for logging
all submitted votes. Do not touch this table!

| *Column:* | *Description:* |
| date | date of that log entry |
| username | name of wikiuser who has voted |
| topic | name of topic which has been voted |
| credit points | number of shared credit points on that topic |

__Note:__ Do not touch this table! It is updating automatically. Any editing manually
will mix up the poll stats.

---+++ Include topic
To include a topic into a poll simply add =%<nop>POLL{...}%= to a topic. 

Supported parameters:

| *Parameter:* | *Description:* | *Default:* |
| =topic=""= | The topic which contains the necessary poll configuration | Current topic |
| =disable=""= | Set disable="1" to disable voting for the current topic | 0 | 

The makro renders a form to submit credit points and vote for the current topic. 
It also adds additional information about the poll:

| *Row:* | *Description:* |
| topic score | Total of all shared credit points on the current topic |
| credit points shared | Total of all shared credit points on the current topic from logged in user |
| credit points left | Remaining credit points for that poll of logged in user | 

You can include as many topics as you want to be part of the poll and get voted by participating users.
